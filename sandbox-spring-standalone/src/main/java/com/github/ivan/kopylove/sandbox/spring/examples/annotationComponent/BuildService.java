 * Annotation @Component has the same effect as @Service. Both annotations are instructing Spring that the annotated class
 * is a candidate for autodetection using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning. However, since
 * the InjectSimpleConfig class is storing the application configuration, rather than providing a business service,
 * using @Component makes more sense. Practically, @Service is a specialization of @Component, which indicates
 * that the annotated class is providing a business service to other layers within the application. (c) Pro Spring 5, 5th Edition
