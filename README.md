# Java sandbox

The collection of atomic, focused and isolated examples to try out different Java language practices and scenarios I
come across. Sometimes examples are comprehensive, sometimes just hello world.

The main advantage of the approach is isolation - I can easily identify a problem in a playground rather in a big
project with sophisticated complexity emerged out of combinations of factors.

Unlike classical `reverse domain name` hierarchy, the package structure are organized
in [faceted classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification). The number of categories grow over
time, so the faceted classification helps me to focus on a business rather on struggling through existing package
structure. So no need to crawl through folders to find appropriate place - I just use search.
