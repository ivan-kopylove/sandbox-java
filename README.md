# Java Sandbox: A Developer's Playground

Welcome to the Java Incubator.

This projects serves as

- a dynamic, evolving space designed to experiment with various Java language practices and
  scenarios.
- a startup incubator for more complex projects — a set of boilerplate snippets / patterns to give a momentum for more
  complex
  projects before the complex project will be extracted into separate structure.

You'll find a range of examples here—from simple "Hello World" applications to more
comprehensive explorations of Java's capabilities.

### Key Features:

- **Atomic, Focused, and Isolated Examples:** Each snippet or application within this repository stands alone, focusing
  on a specific concept or practice. This isolation aids in pinpointing issues or understanding functionality without
  the noise of a larger, more complex project.

- **Faceted Classification:** Moving away from the traditional `reverse domain name hierarchy`, the package structure
  are organized in [faceted classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification). This approach allows
  for the flexible categorization of examples as the repository grows. Faceted classification enables developers to
  concentrate on solving business problems rather than maintaining a rigid folder structure. Simply put, finding
  relevant examples is as easy as performing a search.
