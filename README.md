# Java sandbox

The collection of atomic, focused and isolated examples to try out different Java language practices and scenarios I come across. Sometimes examples are comprehensive, sometimes just hello world.

The main advantage of the approach is isolation - I can easily identify a problem in a playground rather in a big project with sophisticated complexity emerged out of combinations of factors.

Subprojects are organized in a flat structure, so no need to crawl through folders to find required examples.
