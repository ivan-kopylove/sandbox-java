# Java sandbox

The collection of atomic, focused and isolated examples to try out different Java language practices and scenarios I
come across. Sometimes examples are comprehensive, sometimes just hello world.

The main advantage of the approach is isolation - I can easily identify a problem in a playground rather in a big
project with sophisticated complexity emerged out of combinations of factors.

Unlike classical `reverse domain name` hierarchy, the package structure are organized
in [faceted classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification). The number of categories grow over
time, so the faceted classification helps me to focus on a business rather on struggling through existing package
structure. So no need to crawl through folders to find appropriate place - I just use search.

# Java Sandbox: A Developer's Playground

## Repository Description

Welcome to the Java Sandbox! This repository serves as a dynamic, evolving space designed to experiment with various
Java language practices and scenarios. You'll find a range of examples hereâ€”from simple "Hello World" applications to
more comprehensive explorations of Java's capabilities.

### Key Features:

- **Atomic, Focused, and Isolated Examples:** Each snippet or application within this repository stands alone, focusing
  on a specific concept or practice. This isolation aids in pinpointing issues or understanding functionality without
  the noise of a larger, more complex project.

- **Faceted Classification:** Moving away from the traditional `reverse domain name hierarchy`, this repository employs
  a faceted classification system for organizing packages. This approach allows for the flexible categorization of
  examples as the repository grows. Faceted classification enables developers to concentrate on solving business
  problems rather than maintaining a rigid folder structure. Simply put, finding relevant examples is as easy as
  performing a search.
