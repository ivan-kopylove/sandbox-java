# Java sandbox

The collection of atomic and focused examples to try out different Java language practices and scenarios. Sometimes examples are comprehensive, sometimes just hello world.

The main advantage of the approach is isolation - I can easily identify a problem in a playground rather in a big project with sophisticated complexity emerged out of combinations of factors.

Subprojects are organized in a flat structure, so no need to crawl through folders to find required examples.
